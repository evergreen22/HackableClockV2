# User Interface Design

The clock has four buttons labeled **A**, **B**, **C**, and **D** and one switch labeled **Alarm**. This document describes the interface for setup and operation of the clock.

Switch:

* Alarm off - disables alarm and cancels snooze

Buttons:
* A - Snooze
* B - Display alarm time
* C - Display date, year first followed by month and date

    * B - Next function
    * C - Increase/Up
    * D - Decrease/Down
* A+D - Reset clock to defaults

The setup functions are indicated by the decimal points. The functions are numbered from one to nine. Read the decimal points as bits from left to right and convert them to decimal to know which function is being configured.
